            <h4> 1. Innovation. </h4><span>What’s looks simple and comfortable, like a pair of lululemon pants can be backed by a level of innovation that is more than meets the eye. Adidas Boost sneakers contain a comfortable, squishy midsole that absorbs and returns more energy to the person wearing them helping athletes like marathon runners to keep on going. “The thing about Boost is that the minute you put it on, you know it’s a completely different experience than anything else out there” says Andy Barr, Adidas Director of Global Creation. <br /></span>
            <h4> 2. Differentiation. </h4><span>The first Adidas Boost sneaker also differentiated itself by looking different than the sneakers that were popular at the time. A casual and stylish look that is mainstream now. “It’s easy to forget that in 2013, most running shoes didn’t look like [the Ultra Boost] said Barr. That paring of innovation plus style really helped to elevate Adidas. <br /></span>
            <h4> 3. The right collaborations. </h4><span> Collabs are the name of the game in the sneaker world, think about Nike’s rise to fame fuelled by its deal with Michael Jordan. Adidas correctly saw the potential in partnering with Kanye West and gave him the deal Nike wouldn’t. Speaking about the Air Yeezy, Kanye West said: “it was the first shoe to have the same level of impact as an Air Jordan, and I wanted to do more.” Not only did he get to do more, Adidas paid West more in his new deal with Adidas. West negotiated an unheard-of deal: a 15% royalty on wholesale and a marketing fee. It is estimated that Michael Jordan’s deal involves a 5% royalty.  That collaboration has paid dividends, creating the $1.5 billion Yeezy brand and in the process making Adidas relevant again. <br /></span>
